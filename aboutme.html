<h5><center> My name is Betty Zhong, and I am a dog and boba enthusiast! I was born and raised in Guangzhou, a busy city located in south China until I was nine years old. In 2010, my mom and I decided to immigrate to the US, an extremely intimidating and foreign country at the time. Needless to say, I had a difficult time adjusting to this new environment. Fast forward 7 years, I am now a totally americanized teenager, who loves everything this country has to offer. Throughout the years, I have learned love myself and the diverse culture around me. </center></h5>
