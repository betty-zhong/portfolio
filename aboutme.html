<h4><center>
	My name is Betty Zhong, and I am a dog and boba enthusiast!
	I was born and raised in Guangzhou, a busy city located in south China until I was nine years old.
	In 2010, my mom and I decided to immigrate to the US, an extremely intimidating and foreign country at the time.
	Needless to say, I had a difficult time adjusting to this new environment.
	Fast forward 7 years, I am now a totally americanized teenager, who loves everything this country has to offer.
	Throughout the years, I have learned love myself and the diverse culture around me.
